It's really easy to create a bootable Mavericks USB drive provided you have downloaded the Mavericks installer and it's located in your applications folder:

```
sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app --nointeraction
```
